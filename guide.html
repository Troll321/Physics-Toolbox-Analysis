    <h3>Featuress you may want to know:</h3>
    <pre style="font-size: 1.5em;">
<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- You can filter out the data you want to see by pressing on the legend above!</b>
by pressing the legend above the chart for example pressing sx will toggle sx on or off


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Export as CSV is now supported!</b>
ONLY WPS Office can't parse this idk :V
Hey it work's on excel tho, (try changing the limiter to "," if it doesn't work)


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- LSTsx, LSTsy, LSTsz, etc represents the last data exist in the dataset</b>


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Mass can be changed (assume its unit is kg)</b>


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Formula Integral (velocity):</b>
vel[t] = vel[t-1] + (dt*a[t-1])


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Formula Integral S (displacement):</b>
s[t] = s[t-1] + dt*(vel[t-1]+vel[t])/2


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Formula Force:</b>
f[t] = m*a[t]


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Formula Distance:</b>
distance[t] = distance[t-1] + sqrt(| s[t]-s[t-1] |)
Assume disp is a <b>VECTOR</b> and <b>| VECTOR |</b> is taking the magnitude


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Formula Work:</b>
w[t] = w[t-1] + (f[t-1] . (disp[t]-disp[t-1]))
Assume F and disp is a vector and "." is a Dot Product operation between 2 vector
This is the tricky part, if we include gravity we add the z axis with gravity (assuming z is the vertical axis)

Work+ only counts for the positive work
Work- only counts for the negative work


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- The Total (ex: aTot, vTot, sTot) is calculated seperately by taking the magnitude of that vector</b>
Pytahogrean theorem for that: sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2 + az^2)


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Note: Distance is scalar while displacement is vector</b>


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">- Note: its Î”Em not Em, because we don't count the absolute energy, just the change</b>
  (in the calculation we assume the initial energy is 0)


<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">GRAVITY: 9.80665 m/s^2</b>
